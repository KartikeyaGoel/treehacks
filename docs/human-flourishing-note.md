# Human Flourishing: Family-Tested Patient Report

The SOMNI AI patient report is designed to be read with or to a family member (parent, partner, or trusted person).

## Design Principles

- **8th-grade reading level** (Flesch-Kincaid scoring)
- **Hopeful, empathetic tone** that validates effort
- **Normalizes variation** ("Many people see temporary changes...")
- **Clear disclaimers** — "What This Does NOT Mean" section
- **Actionable next steps** — "What You Can Do"
- **Avoids alarming language** — frames findings as patterns to understand, not problems to fear

## Empathy Elements

### Opening Validation
"Taking an interest in your sleep patterns is a positive step toward understanding your health."

### Normalization Statement
For non-stable findings: "Many people experience temporary changes in sleep patterns. Our goal is to help you understand patterns over time, not to cause worry. Sleep naturally varies, and these observations are meant to support conversations with your provider."

### Supportive Framing
- Findings presented as research associations, not diagnoses
- Confidence levels clearly stated
- Uncertainty acknowledged
- Agency emphasized ("What You Can Do")

## Testing

- Designed for family reading: suitable for sharing with loved ones in healthcare conversations
- Reviewed for clarity and emotional tone
- Tested to ensure it feels supportive, not clinical or scary

## Alignment with Human Flourishing

This approach aligns with our belief that **AI technology should serve human potential** by:
- Making health intelligence **accessible** (clear language, visual aids)
- Making it **understandable** (no jargon, explained statistics)
- Making it **supportive** (empathetic tone, hope-focused)
- **Reducing fear** (disclaimers, normalization, actionable steps)

By designing the patient report to be shared with family members, we ensure that sleep health insights strengthen relationships and support informed healthcare conversations — not create anxiety or confusion.
